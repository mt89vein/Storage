## Storage project

"Storage" is a research project to find an effective way to store binary data on the disc.

"Storage" project written for another project for use as abstraction layer on top of filesystem.

Written on C# 7.3 .net core, with google protobuf for serializations/deserializations.

The main idea is chunking data to data pages and using BTree index for fast lookup and read data.
